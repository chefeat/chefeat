## About
Chefeat is a free social mobile app built due to the effects of COVID-19.
The developers are two students at the Ben-Gurion University Of The Negev in Israel, which conflicted with quarantine issues such as - "What can we cook with what we have available?" / "What else we can cook besides pasta?.."

This app serves hundreds of users and dozens of daily users which Chefeat hopes to maintain a varied daily menu of dishes.
